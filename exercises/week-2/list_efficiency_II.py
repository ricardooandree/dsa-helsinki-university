""" Description:
Implement a test, where the numbers 1,2,...,n are added to the end of the list one at a time. Then the first element of the list is deleted n times.
Implement the test with n=10^5. Make two time measurements: How much time it takes to do all the additions, and how much time to do all the deletions.
In this task you get a point automatically when you fill in your measurement results and the code used in the test, and press the submit button.
