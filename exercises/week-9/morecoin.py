""" Description:
You have coins of values 1, 4 and 5. What is the smallest number of coins needed form the sum x exactly?
In this task, 1 <= x <= 10^{100}, i.e., x can be very large. The algorithm should be efficient in all cases.
In a file morecoin.py, implement a function count that returns the smallest number of coins.
