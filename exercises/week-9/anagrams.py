""" Description:
An anagram of a string contains the characters of the string in some order. Your task is to construct all the anagrams of a given string.
You may assume that the string consists of the characters aâ€“z and contains at most 8 characters. The algorithm should be efficient in all of these cases.
In a file anagrams.py, implement a function create that returns a sorted list of the anagrams.
