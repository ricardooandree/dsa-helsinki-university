""" Description:
The number of balanced parenthesis sequences can also be counted with the formula

(1/(n/2 + 1))(n n/2)

Here (a b) is a binomial coefficient that can be computed with the formula

(a!/(b!(a-b)!))

Based on these formulas, implement a function count_sequences and verify that the function returns the correct answer for n=100.
In addition, compare the efficiency of this function and the dynamic programming function in the course material for different values of n.
In this task, you get a point automatically when you fill in your implementation of the function and the results of the comparison, and press the submit button.
