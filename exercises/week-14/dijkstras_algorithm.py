""" Description:
Test the operation of the Dijkstra's algorithm given in the course material using a graph constructed as follows:

The nodes are 1,2,...,N and N=5000.
The start node is the node 1.
There is an edge from a node a to a node b, if a<b and b-a<10.
The weight of each edge is a random number in the range 1 ... 1000.
The edges are in a random order on the edge list.
