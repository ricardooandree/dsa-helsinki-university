""" Description:
Implement a class QuickList with the following methods:

move(k): move the first k elements of the list to the end of the list
get(i): return the element at the index i

The initial contents of the list is given as a parameter to the constructor. The time complexity of both methods should be O(1).
In a file quicklist.py, implement a class QuickList according to the following template:
"""


""" Explanation:
Explanation: The contents of the list in the example changes as follows:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
move(3) -> [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3]
move(3) -> [7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6]
move(10) -> [7,8,9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6]
move(7) -> [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2,3]
move(5) -> [9,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
